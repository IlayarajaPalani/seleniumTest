A constructor in Java is a block of code similar to a method that's called when an instance of an object is created
A class contains constructors that are invoked to create objects from the class blueprint. Constructor declarations look like method declarations—except that they use the name of the class and have no return type
•	A constructor doesn’t have a return type.
•	The name of the constructor must be the same as the name of the class.

super is used to invoke parent class constructor

An interface is a reference type in Java. It is similar to class. a class implements interface therby inheriting the abstract methods of the interface
When a class implements multiple interface, its called as multiple inheritance and also if the interface extends multiple interface

An abstract method is a method that is declared, but contains no implementation. Abstract classes may not be instantiated, and require subclasses to provide implementations for the abstract methods. 

Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms
Example : when salary class extends employee. We can instantiate two salary object one for salary and other can be used to map to empoyee
Salary s = new Salary("Mohd Mohtashim", "Ambehta, UP", 3, 3600.00);
      Employee e = new Salary("John Adams", "Boston, MA", 2, 2400.00);

What is xPath
XML Path for finding any element on the webpage

<input id="txtName" class="textboxcss" tabindex="1" type="text">
// - select current node
tagname - Tagname like input or div or image 
@ - Select attribute
Attribute - Attribute name of the node like id or name 
Value = is the path or value of the attribute

CSS Selector
CSS Selector by id,class, attribute,ID/Class & Attribute , Sub String and inner text
Id
css=<HTML tag><#><Value of ID attribute>
css=input#Email”
Class
css=<HTML tag><.><Value of Class attribute>
 “css=label.remember” 
attribute
<HTML tag><[attribute=Value of attribute]>
“css=input[type=’submit’]”
css=<HTML tag><[attribute^=prefix of the string]> 
css=<HTML tag><[attribute$=sufix of the string]> 
css=<HTML tag><[attribute*=substring of the string]> 


Enum in java is a data type that contains fixed set of constants
 
 
 @DataProvider

    public Object[][] Authentication() throws Exception{

         Object[][] testObjArray = ExcelUtils.getTableArray("D://ToolsQA//OnlineStore//src//testData//TestData.xlsx","Sheet1");

         return (testObjArray);

Embed Screenshot to TestNG Report

File scrFile = ((TakesScreenshot)driver).getScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE);
//The below method will save the screen shot in d drive with name "screenshot.png"
timeStamp = new SimpleDateFormat("yyyyMMdd_HHmmss").format(Calendar.getInstance().getTime()); 
screenShotName = new File("D:\\TestingDen\\Screenshots\\"+timeStamp+".png");
FileUtils.copyFile(scrFile, screenShotName)
String filePath = screenShotName.toString();
String path = "<img src=\"file://" + filePath + "\" alt=\"\"/>";
Reporter.log(path);
